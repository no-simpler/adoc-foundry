= Adoc Foundry: Vagrant box and shell script for all things Asciidoc/Asciidoctor
:ast: *

This setup aims to create a truly cross-platform hassle-free way to transform Asciidoc/Asciidoctor files of any complexity to quality HTML/PDF.

Under the hood it pulls a Vagrant box with Fedora Linux, installs Asciidoctor (and its many sibling projects), Phantomjs, and Prince, along with all the necessary dependencies.

It works as such:

[source,bash]
----
$ vagrant up

…

$ vagrant ssh

…

[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ ./af.sh
----

… and all `{ast}.adoc` files in `/src` directory become `{ast}.html` files in `/out` directory.

Want a PDF? Use `-p` option. This will activate `asciidoctor-pdf`.

Want a PDF with CSS styling and complex LaTeX math? Use `-P` option. This will activate `phantomjs` and `prince` post-processing.
